Simple Blockchain Explorer is a node set of code useful to integrate easily the
mechanism of a BIP-37 Bitcoin node, for a KISS development of events in the 
blockchain, without downloading the all the blocks. 

The project will include a blockchain explorer as a proof of concept and example
to help developers, and build something useful ;-) Now it provide only a CLI.
