# Simple Explorer: the SPV Explorer
Simple Explorer is a **BIP-37 programmable** blockchain explorer.
It is designed to be a SPV Bitcoin node using NodeJS, to develop KISS pieces 
of software using the blockchain, without downloading the all the full blocks

The project will include a blockchain explorer as a proof of concept and 
example to help developers, and build something *useful*. Now it provide only 
a CLI

**Note**: Still under heavy development, please help and contribute with issues
or pull requests :-)
