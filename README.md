# Simple Explorer: the SPV Explorer
Simple Explorer is a BIP-37 blockchain explorer.
It is designed to be a SPV Bitcoin *programmable* node, for a KISS development 
of software using the blockchain, without downloading the all the full blocks. 

The project will include a blockchain explorer as a proof of concept and 
example to help developers, and build something useful ;-) Now it provide only 
a CLI.

**Note**: Still under heavy development, feel free to contribute with issues 
and pull requests!
